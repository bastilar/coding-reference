1. Order of functions written matter. Compiler reads from top to bottom so if a function(A) needs to call another function(B), function (B) must be above function (A).
Talk about thinking in reverse. Yikes.

2. To skip lines in printing, use either:

std::cout << "Some text displayed here" << std::endl; //(messy and long)
or:
std::cout << "Some text displayed here \n";

3.         std::cin.clear(); //clear alphanumeric errors
        std::cin.ignore(); //clear weird character/symbol errors
Funny enough, we may not need these as unreal apparently takes care of this automatically.

4. can set boolean variables equal to a function that returns a bool to determine when a while loop remains true or false or vice versa:
while(true)
    {
        bool bLevelComplete = PlayGame();
    }
