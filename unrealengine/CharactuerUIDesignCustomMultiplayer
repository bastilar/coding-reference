https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-character-ui/learn/lecture/22571458#questions time 10:30 / 11:00
What this is doing is reversing the button we originally hovered over BEFORE we play a new button animation and then setting the selected index to the newly selected
button, hence why we play the reverse animation function we made before playing the new one. Reverse the old button, play foward the new button. Presto.

We get our selected ability index variable and do a not equal check then branch it to the button event function call. We fire the normal code off when the condition
is "true" since selected index 1 does not equal our current ability button of 1. We repeat with button 2 with 2's, button 3 with 3's, etc.
