1. Character retargeting tutorial #1 https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13378114#overview

2. Jump z velocity determines how high you jump.

3. Arrow component can be used to spawn particles by assigning a spot in your blueprint where something happens
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13120340#overview time 7:00

4. Using is falling boolean, which is derived from character movement component of your bp character mesh, and do a branch. If character is falling, then do not play
the sfx and sound 2d etc. Unless you want that. https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13120362#overview time 6:00

5. Landing sound effects and particle effects https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13120386#overview

6. **** Create wbp widget then link it to the add to viewpoint blueprint node
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13123912#overview time 4:20
Probably useful later for adding and then removing an additoinal hud, like a tank / vehicle hud.

7. **** Creating animations for your hud https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124006#overview

8. If you don't like the bouncey effect, set key interpolation to linear from auto or cubic etc
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13582202#overview time 9:30

9. Telling your hud animations to play when you load up the game screen
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

10. **** Since you can only have 1 event or custom event, you could use a "sequence" node to get aroudn this limitation. Then 0 fires off first, then Then 1, etc
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

11. Do once after event constuct so the animation doesn't keep playing when we bring up white magic menu
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

12. **** Might need to call a bp actor that will hold all the skill logic. perhaps we could just use the bp character base in fps3.0
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124158#overview

13. **** Creating and customizing materials from textures only, this is how you use those material assets that don't have premade materials for you to work with in
the UE marketplace https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124186#overview time 6:50

13. You can change hte shape in the material from sphere to cube by clicking the small cube icon when you double click the material and on the preview shape on the
left side.

13. Creating and modifying material instances out of thin air for easily modifiable materials
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13129184#overview

14. Data and structs revisited https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13129462#overview

15. **** Enums list out the specific list of things or skills you want. Structs or structures contain the fields and variables that EACH thing or skill will contain.
The skill name "fireball" and "psionic blast" goes in the Enum, but the stamina cost and damage type variables for each skill goes into the structure.

16. Binding code to a popup black magic menu
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13809708#overview most likely need to re-adapt this to a pure node function code
as we probably will not use binding functions for multiplayer.

17. **** Select nodes are very versatile in that once you hook up an input type, all the select node inputs will change to that same type. Float will change to
all floats, ints to all integers, sound to play to sound to play, etc.

18. **** Sound base / soundbase object reference is used to play sfx when say a skill is acquired or selected (if you want)
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13823842#overview time 13:30

19. **** Using vectors start and end position to make a skill book in the world bob up and down then use timelines.
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13847578#overview make sure to create the beginning start and end vector variables
first (see end of #18 note above)
Lerp returns the new vector location between two points.

20. **** Animation notifies https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132544#overview

21. **** When menus collide, set visibility to block?
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132558#overview time 8:30

22. **** Blueprint interface implementation https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132558#overview
This is what is used to help create those popup mini message menus like "Press F to loot" highly useful for learning the ammo box implementation and creating
lootable containers.

23. **** There are 3 types of blueprint interface node calls. One is directly from an out hit actor result. Second is target is bp_player call function.
Third is an bp interface call class. The first one has an envelope for an icon so you know one blueprint is connecting and sending messages to another blueprint
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132558#overview time 17:05 

24. Set game input mode to game game and ui https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132672#overview time 3:00
Not sure if we will need this but allows for buttons to be pushed while everything else is active. However, our multiplayer game will never be paused.
This also allows you to "set show mouse cursor". Both these blueprint code nodes are derived from "get player controller" node.

25. Num loops to play in animation bp / blueprint node can be set to infinite loop if you input the value "0" or "zero"
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132672#overview time 10:20 

26. Anim bp revisited **** https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13142912#overview

27. **** Passing variables from BP_Player to the animation blueprint / animbp 
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13142912#overview time 7:30.

It appears you need to create variables for each item you want to pull from your bp-player, which makes sense since you have to store what you pulled somewhere
inside the anim bp.

28. **** Transition rules between double jump to normal jump then landing, ish
time 9:30 https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13142944#overview

29. **** If you experience animation hitching (or rubber banding?) you can select the transition rule that is causing the hitching / glitching and select the
checkbox "Enable automatic rule based on sequence player in state"

30. Sound effect randomizer on play with custom made sound cues using mixers and random pallete bp / blueprint nodes
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13143000#overview time 9:30

31. Particle vfx editing https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13143968#overview time 5:30
and https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/14204368#overview

32. **** Lerping vectors or going from point A to poing B using lerps and timelines, using the 0 to 1 float movement value from timelines to plug into the alpha
value for the lerp blueprint node https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144104#overview time 6:00

33. If your particle emitters keep playing and looping ,and the play animation blueprint node seems correct, check the particle mesh itself that is spawning and
see if the emitter loops is set to 0, which means it's replaying itself over and over again forever. Obviously change it to 1 or whatever the value you want or need
it to be.

34. **** To have a variable of any kind show up in your class defaults tab of your blueprint, you need to promote that variable or object to variable, then assign a
category to it for organizational purposes. It's all automatic otherwise as soon as you promote to variable.

35. **** Creating variables that then pass into the anim bp graph to determine which animations to play
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144126#overview
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144292#overview

36. **** Fireball implementation and animations start https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144358#overview
Probably will form foundation of a lot of projectile based abilities like psionic blast etc.

37. Collision object type, useful for when you need specific behavior for fireball projectiles or in our case, psionic projectiles
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144358#overview time 8:00

38. Fireball spawn point is placed as an arrow component inside bp_player
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13144398#overview time 2:00

39. E_num black magic slotted functionality using a switch
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145482#overview time 3:40

40. **** Blending animations together using layered blend by bone
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145494#overview time 4:00

41. **** Under layer setup, you need to click on branch filter and include spine_01 or the corresponding bone to split the animations from
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145494#overview time 5:14

42. **** Time remaining ratio (cast) refers to how much time is remaining left on the animation. So if you set the float to 0.3, that means transition to
next animation / anim state when the animation has 30% left of its animation left to play out
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145494#overview time 8:50

43. **** Adding animation / anim notifies to play particle effects and sound effects
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/14263066#overview time 8:00

44. **** If your own projectile is hitting yourself, check the collision settings on the spawned projectile and set it to ignore.
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/14263066#overview time 14:20 However, this may cause a problem as you do want it
colliding with other pawns.

45. Floating pawn movement component allows a pawn to fly I suppose.
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145566#overview time 1:35

46. **** You can use blueprint timelines to disable collisions, even temporarily by manipulating the value of the float (usually 1 and 0)
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13145610#overview time 6:30

47. **** A common mistake when enabling input is plugging the get player controller into target instead of "player controller" input in the Enable Input
blueprint node https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/14286774#overview time 2:45

48. Casting an ability in mid air where you want your character to float mid air using the floating pawn movement component node
