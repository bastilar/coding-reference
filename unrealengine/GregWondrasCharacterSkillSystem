1. Character retargeting tutorial #1 https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13378114#overview

2. Jump z velocity determines how high you jump.

3. Arrow component can be used to spawn particles by assigning a spot in your blueprint where something happens

4. Using is falling boolean, which is derived from character movement component of your bp character mesh, and do a branch. If character is falling, then do not play
the sfx and sound 2d etc. Unless you want that. https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13120362#overview time 6:00

5. Landing sound effects and particle effects https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13120386#overview

6. **** Create wbp widget then link it to the add to viewpoint blueprint node
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13123912#overview time 4:20
Probably useful later for adding and then removing an additoinal hud, like a tank / vehicle hud.

7. **** Creating animations for your hud https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124006#overview

8. If you don't like the bouncey effect, set key interpolation to linear from auto or cubic etc

9. Telling your hud animations to play when you load up the game screen
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

10. **** Since you can only have 1 event or custom event, you could use a "sequence" node to get aroudn this limitation. Then 0 fires off first, then Then 1, etc
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

11. Do once after event constuct so the animation doesn't keep playing when we bring up white magic menu
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124038#overview

12. **** Might need to call a bp actor that will hold all the skill logic. perhaps we could just use the bp character base in fps3.0
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124158#overview

13. **** Creating and customizing materials from textures only, this is how you use those material assets that don't have premade materials for you to work with in
the UE marketplace https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13124186#overview time 6:50

13. You can change hte shape in the material from sphere to cube by clicking the small cube icon when you double click the material and on the preview shape on the
left side.

13. Creating and modifying material instances out of thin air for easily modifiable materials
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13129184#overview

14. Data and structs revisited https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13129462#overview

15. **** Enums list out the specific list of things or skills you want. Structs or structures contain the fields and variables that EACH thing or skill will contain.
The skill name "fireball" and "psionic blast" goes in the Enum, but the stamina cost and damage type variables for each skill goes into the structure.

16. Binding code to a popup black magic menu
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13809708#overview most likely need to re-adapt this to a pure node function code
as we probably will not use binding functions for multiplayer.

17. **** Select nodes are very versatile in that once you hook up an input type, all the select node inputs will change to that same type. Float will change to
all floats, ints to all integers, sound to play to sound to play, etc.

18. **** Sound base / soundbase object reference is used to play sfx when say a skill is acquired or selected (if you want)
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13823842#overview time 13:30

19. **** Using vectors start and end position to make a skill book in the world bob up and down then use timelines.
https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13847578#overview make sure to create the beginning start and end vector variables
first (see end of #18 note above)
Lerp returns the new vector location between two points.

20. **** Animation notifies https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-character-skill-system/learn/lecture/13132544#overview

21. **** When menus collide, set visibility to block?
