1. Import assets quickly from quixel to unreal engine immediately

2. LODs or level of details explained https://www.udemy.com/course/make-photorealistic-outdoor-environment-in-unreal-engine-daniel-krafft/learn/lecture/17378820#overview
this means the further away u get from an object the less detailed it becomes. This is probably how performance is optimized.

3. Custom objects may not have LOD's so there are 2 ways to create them. Unreal engine has an auto lod function when you double click the asset
https://www.udemy.com/course/make-photorealistic-outdoor-environment-in-unreal-engine-daniel-krafft/learn/lecture/17378820#overview time 1:10 
After you set lod to "auto" scroll further down and then select the type of actor object that best describes your actor. Is it a small prop or large one? Is it
foliage? Etc.

4. Placing plants and foliage quickly and easily with unreal engine

https://www.udemy.com/course/make-photorealistic-outdoor-environment-in-unreal-engine-daniel-krafft/learn/lecture/17199550#overview

23. Sometimes quixel mixer doesn't export everything ot unreal from quixel bridge so you just open the folder from bridge that contains your materials for your
created material texture and just drag and drop them into unreal project.

26. Height maps are black and white texture data that unreal engine reads to figure out troughs, valleys, and peaks in your landscape terrain. Black is for lows, white
is for high peaks. 1px / 1 pixel = 1 meter. A resoultion of 1000px by 1000px means you have a 1000 by 1000 meter landscape size
