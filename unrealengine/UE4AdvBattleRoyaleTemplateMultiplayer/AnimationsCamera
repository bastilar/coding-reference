2. If reload and other functions don't work after creating / replacing the mesh, go into the weapon blueprints:
"Reload montage can be found inside the weapon blueprint itself, for example the sniper rifle blueprint open it and in Class defaults search for Reload, 
that's where we set what montage to play, make sure you retarget that one and set the new one there as well."

4. Before retargeting, enable show all retargeting options and select "set recursive animation skeleton" fix option
