Epic Launcher can import assets like normal. However, for plugins, you will need to use a launcher version of unreal, import to that project, then copy and paste
the files from the launcher version of Unreal Engine into the source-compiled version of Unreal Engine.

It may be a better idea to import the plugins to a dummy project for faster load times.

2. Speeding up compile and build times possibly https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/faster-compile-times/148765/4
in the build.cs file add:

PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
PrivatePCHHeaderFile = "MaulProtoPrecompiled.h";
MinFilesUsingPrecompiledHeaderOverride = 1;
bUseUnity = false;

There's also a precompile header:

// MaulProtoPrecompiled.h

#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "Engine.h"
