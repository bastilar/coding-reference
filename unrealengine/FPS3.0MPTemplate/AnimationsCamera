2. The save button was removed in the retarget manager. It is now called "Use current pose" when you click the "modify pose" button.

3. Arm stretching fixes (ie belica) is due to animation retarget translation set to animation instead of skeleton. You'll have to manually fix each bone part manually

Also applies to legs and other distorted body parts.

Usually arms and legs get distorted when retargeting skeleton / skeletal meshes, so retarget the cavicles, arms, thighs, legs to "skeleton" instead of "animation".
Will also have to do the same for parts attached to the limbs like the shoulderpads or thighpads if they look distorted.

5. Remove paragon weapons in case you forgot https://youtu.be/32Sh_6rga7Y
Override opacity blend, attach a constant INPUT and set the final return node to transluscent instead of opaque

6. You may need to manually copy and paste the weapon and flag sockets to the new retargeted animations such as weaponpoint, knife, grenade, flagpoint, etc

7. If weapons look odd, add the preview asset of the weapon to the weaponpoint or other problematic socket to adjust the rotation.

8. **** When retargeting from an animation pose make sure to use the one in the TPP Animations directory and NOT THE BASE UE4 Manequin.
