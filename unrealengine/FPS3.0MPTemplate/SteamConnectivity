1. It appears fps 3.0 template doesn't come with steam functionality properly built in. Will have to follow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFSgTUTYTko and install the advanced sessions and advanced sessions steam plugins from
https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/advanced-sessions-plugin/30020 which is updated very often thankfully.

2. There is an issue with the server not showing up in the "internet" in the client or steam but that oculd be because the game is not being launched from steam,
as obviously the app isn't in the steam servers.

3.
