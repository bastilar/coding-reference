1. Before you can package a dedicated server, you need to compile the source unreal engine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRJUWC90aJM

2. First steps package and setup the unreal engine dedicated server package

3. Then modify with fps3.0 template instructions

4. **** Shipping builds do not include the -log functionality. Solutions:
https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/383407/how-to-log-in-shipping-build-win.html

5. It may be a better idea to try using test build, as that is shipping build with a few extra unreal engine things.

6. **** Bear in mind the reason shipping builds strip out all the extra unreal dev stuff is because optimization and space is a big issue, esp. if you're leaving servers
on forever. Eventualy it will run out of hd or ram or both.

7. Enabling steam functionality https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smIjgP18Q43UtIF7rqlMtJO8IjX7lELX/view?usp=sharing

8. **** Make sure there are no white blocks in your server log command prompt! It will pause the server! Press enter to resume the server.

10. Opening ports in steam https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/2EA8-4D75-DA21-31EB and how to add a new server inbound port rule for windows 2019 / windows 2016
https://www.osradar.com/how-to-open-a-firewall-port-in-windows-server-2019-2016/ When opening ports, make sure to open all the ports that dedicated servers will use
in the future. For example, if instance #6 will use port 27321, make sure that port is open in the windows advanced firewall settings. You can also set UDP ports
to open all ports for ease. But tcp may be risky so maybe just specify a big range like 27000-27901 for the query ports.

You will need to then refer back to https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/advanced-sessions-plugin/30020 or
https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/Online/Steam/ to add:
		Basically you want to add the following to the ProjectName.Target.cs
		/*
 * This is our Steam App ID.
 */
GlobalDefinitions.Add("UE4_PROJECT_STEAMSHIPPINGID=480");

/*
 * This is used on SetModDir(), and should be the same as your Product Name
 * under Dedicated Game Server Information in Steamworks
 */
GlobalDefinitions.Add("UE4_PROJECT_STEAMGAMEDIR=\"Spacewar\"");
		
		and the following to the ProjectNameServer.Target.cs
		/*
 * This is our Steam App ID.
 */
GlobalDefinitions.Add("UE4_PROJECT_STEAMSHIPPINGID=480");

/*
 * This is used on SetProduct(), and should be the same as your Product Name

GlobalDefinitions.Add("UE4_PROJECT_STEAMGAMEDIR=\"Spacewar\"");

/*

		Also be sure to install the steam client on the server host machine (easy enough)

11. Check the thread from https://www.reddit.com/r/unrealengine/comments/h9rl7o/my_unsuccessful_experience_so_far_trying_to_setup/ for the build.cs, target.cs,
and servertarget.cs configs.

13. ****** When you update builds, you need to update the "Dedicated Game Servers Information" latest version field found at:
https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/dedicatedservers/theappidofthegame (obviously login to the steamworks dev backend). This page is found via
Appname->edit steam works settings-> application dropdown -> dedicated servers tab

Would need to update version number at main menu number on lower left corner, the unreal engine project settings page, and the steamworks dedicated game servers
information page.

14. ****** To run mulitple instances of a game on the same machine host, use:
Hey there! After trying around my self, I figured it out. You have to use different ports for both servers, and not only the game server port but also the Steam query port. By default this is 7777 and for Steam 27015, so your second server should use 7778 and 27016 as an example :)

You can set that by launching your first server (shortcut) with

 Server.exe -Port=7777 -QueryPort=27015
and your second one with

 Server.exe -Port=7778 -QueryPort=27016
 
 example:
 I got it to work, thank you very much for your help!

For everyone else who runs into the issue, using a shortcut with the arguments

for the first server: "C:\Location\GameServer.exe" -logs -queryport=27105 -port=7777 -log

for the second server: "C:\Location\GameServer.exe" -logs -queryport=27106 -port=7778 -log

15. Dedicated servers by default do not have players but fps 3.0 template checks to see if at least 1 player is present in the server, then if it finds at least 1
or more players, create the server widget. This is why the server was not showing up anywhere.
