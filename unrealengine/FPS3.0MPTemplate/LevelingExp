1. You can format text to have premade text then feed the variable text that actually changes. For example:
Level: {X} with say "Level: whateveryourvariablevalueis" https://youtu.be/g4c8shcfyQY?t=810

2. To maybe get the score and other bp_playerstate variables, do:
"Instead of trying to cast to the character get all actors of class then get a copy of the array and drag is valid from it and the function from that character"

3. Leveling exp code:

Leveling EXP Code - Need To Get Game Mode Cast To Bp_Base_GM To Get All Player PCs. Then For each loop it cast to Bp_BasePlayerController.
Afterwards Cast Each To BP_BaseCharacter to call ServerEXPGAIN Leveling Function And Feed It Player Score

It's located in BP_PlayerState And references BP_Base_GS (Note it says GS *not* GM. Base game state)

4. Apparently game states already contain an array of player states that store each individual score of the player.

5. **** Every player controller has a direct reference to their player state.
