1. There's multiple ways to generate collision events, which of course means everything is goign to block each other or go through each other. Currently, our
projectiles are using "overlap" events to generate gameplay logic. This means that walls and static meshes must have "generate overlap events" enabled or else
projectiles will just go right through them. Box brushes do not have any collisions.

We are also marking walls, boxes, barrels, etc, with actor "tags" named "HardObject". Both these things are needed to generate the proper overlap event.
