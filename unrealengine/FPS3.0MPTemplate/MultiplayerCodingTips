1. Calling a multicast RPC function from a client will only execute on a client, whereas multicast called from a server calls it on both server and all connected
clients. https://cedric-neukirchen.net/Downloads/Compendium/UE4_Network_Compendium_by_Cedric_eXi_Neukirchen.pdf page 62.

4. **** If you encounter a state or a broken up set of data structs and variable outputs, pull out the variable and right click on it and select "split struct pin"
to unfurl all the outputs and inputs.

5. If you run a client rpc from the server, the function will run on the owning client. https://youtu.be/JOJP0CvpB8w?t=640
If you call a server rpc from the CLIENT, then the function will run on the server https://youtu.be/JOJP0CvpB8w?t=648

So critical gameplay logic all occurs in server functions, but you need to create client functions to update THE Display of what happened and its values.
Hitpoints decreased by 50 on the server but server must tell the client to run a client function updating their new health value.
