1. In rush, the variable state is 0 or 1. This sets which bombs are active at any given time. This affects which bomb objectives are active.

2. Player spawns are set to either state 1 (red) or 0 (blue). These numbers might need to refuse given the confusing nature of how they were implemented. When
implementing team beta/blue team, make sure to check "team" checkbox in the playerspawn object actor as well, or else the player can't spawn.

3. To change how many rush objectives there are, go into BP_Rush_GS (gamestate) and chagne final state default value to 3 (for 3 state in the bomb ojbectives).
For example, we have state 0, 1, 2, and 3. 3 is the last 2x bombs to blow up so final state should be 3.
