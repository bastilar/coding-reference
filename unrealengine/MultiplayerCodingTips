1. Setting up multiplayer (a basic one) is as easy as clicking the arrow next to "play" in the unreal editor and selecting the number of players in the level/game/map.
Note that as of unreal 4.25, you need to set the net mode as "play as listen server". See https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7761712#overview

2. Use source tree (free!) to run version control on unreal engine programs https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7761712#overview time 10:20.

3. Synchronus means "together at the same time" such as mmo's, persistent worlds, and most fps first person shooter games. Turn based games like chess played through
email are Asynchronus because you take turns and there is time lag and you each take "turns" playing.

4. Each player "state" is updated when you receive inputs from every other player in the game/network. That means the slowest connection speed is the weakest link
in this state. It's very insecure and slow. A central authority server fixes this and prevents obvious cheating. See 
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7764312#overview time 3:00

5. Servers can execute code because it HasAuthority or has server authority as opposed to clients. See 
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7778522#questions/8885998 and notice that the server can have the cube move while the client doesn't.

6. To have the server replicate actors or other things to clients and ONLY the server, use set replicates:
void AMovingPlatform::BeginPlay()
{
	Super::BeginPlay();

	SetReplicates(true);
	SetReplicateMovement(true);
}
See https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7778978#questions/8885998 time 7:10

7. Authority and replication https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7778978#questions/8885998 what happens if client can update positions but
the server does not, despite server being authoritative( always right). Time 10:00

8. Since server is always right, if server and client disagree, the client will see the server's real position of items and actors to it's actual original location on
the server. This would explain why objects or people "snap" back into the actual position. Server is always right! See video in #7, timestamp 15:00.

9. If you need to add or edit a target location for an object or actor (but not move the object itself), use gizmo fvector widgets
Code:
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, Meta = (MakeEditWidget = true))
	FVector TargetLocation;
	
See https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7806128#questions/8885998 Time 2:00

10. Note that from #9, when using a target location that can be moved independent of the actor itself, the location is RELATIVE to the actor. It is NOT world / absolute
relative.

11. Revisiting vectors and explanations on how to calculate them https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7806128#questions/8885998 Time 6:00

12. Calculating vectors from point a to b https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7806128#questions/8885998 time 8:00
		FVector Direction = (TargetLocation - Location).GetSafeNormal(); // for not modifying the vector in place
		//FVector Direction = (TargetLocation - Location).Normalize(); will modify the vector in place that is being calculated upon.
		no protection against problems if dealing with very small numbers (precise numbers?)	

13. When calculating vectors from point a to b, it's:
Location += XSpeed * DeltaTime * Direction;

instead of:
Location += FVector(XSpeed * DeltaTime, 0, 0);

14. Sometimes you just want to convert your local target position to world position and not modify its direction or anywhere else.
		FVector GlobalTargetLocation = GetTransform().TransformPosition(TargetLocation); //does just that vs.
				FVector GlobalTargetLocation = GetTransform().TransformVector(TargetLocation); // will affect the scaling of the vector and direction
See https://github.com/bastilar/coding-reference/edit/master/unrealengine/MultiplayerCodingTips time 13:00

15. When swapping variables, you need to create a temporary variable to store the original values before swapping and setting them equal to new values.
see https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7814240#questions time 12:30 where we swap Globaltargetlocation and globalstartlocation.

38. Binding widget and c++ to UMG https://benui.ca/unreal/ui-bindwidget/

39. When binding a widget automatically through c++ to a UMG object like a button, the names must match exactly from c++ to the object name in your umg. If you
create a host button and use the name "Host" the button name in UMG must also exactly say "Host". See

aka using dependencies or invert /inverted dependencies dependency

42. 2 types of dependencies exist, compile time dependencies that go one direction, and runtime dependencies that go both directions

43. Interfaces are what is used to bridge main menu dependencies with game intsances https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7911678#questions/15517460
time 3:00 
Main menu calls and inherits from the interface and the game instance calls and inherits from the interface. Then the main menu can refer to the game instance afterwards
via the interface since the interface is being shared between them all.

44. How to create an unreal interface https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7911678#questions/15517460 time 5:30

45. The first class that is created by default in UInterface is UINTERFACE minimal api
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7911678#questions/15517460 time 6:30 
This is done so that unreal can figure out where to inherit from 1 time and not cause "diamond inheritance" where you have a constant cycle of inheriting from other
classes and causing a weird loop. Interface functions are implemented in the second function as shown by default IMenuInterface

46. In order to call a function that is not implemented in our interface but rather have the game instance call its own implementation, you create a pure virtual void
function https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7911678#questions/15517460 time 9:15 where you tell c++ to override its default behavior to look
for an implementation of a function. Example code:

public:
	virtual void Host() = 0;

or called upon game instances/classes https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7911624#questions/15517460 time 5:00

49. Deactivating the menu to allow us control of our characters again after joining a server. Probably have to do this after a player hits the "queue" button to remove
their menu ui and allow them to retake control of their characters https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7915790#questions/15517460

50. Using submenus and menu switchers to create toggles between menus https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7916890#questions/15517460
We use these instead of creating new menus to replace the old one because I guess it's less "heavy", whatever that means. Widget switcher

51. Editable text box actually refers to "text box" widget in unreal engine 4.26, NOT EDITABLE TEXT. This will clear up any weird "text box internal compile blueprint
errors. Example:

	UPROPERTY(meta = (BindWidget))
	class UEditableTextBox* IPAddressField;

61. Auto can be used to auto declare a variable type if you have no idea what variable type you are declaring is
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8094648#questions time 6:30
Likely a good idea not to auto everything as it will make code hard to read AND result in a performance drop/hit
Auto is obviously very good for figuring out variable type syntaxes.

62. Shared pointers require apparently use of .IsValid() instead of the == or != when checking ot see if it's equal to something or null

63. Memory stack re explained. https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8099224#questions The important part is as function calls complete
and "return" from whatever it is doing, it CLEARS the memory stack frame, which probably frees up memory and enhances performance.

64. Memory cleaning very important because you don't want memory leaks like in badly made games
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8099224#questions Time 4:00 This can be avoided by cleaning and clearing pointers in memory
otherwise you have memory leakage and therefore system halting lag.

65. Memory reference counting https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8099224#questions time 4:25

66. Reference counting apparently sucks, use garbage collection as an alternate memory method fix instead
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8099224#questions time 7:00

67. Unreal online subsystem plugin interfaces use tsharedpointers / t shared pointers because you want to be able to use a reference set of pointers instead of
uobjects. Garbage collection deletes all unused objects and that could easily compromise the online subsystem objects, which we obviously don't want.
https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/8099224#questions time 10:00

68. Note garbage collection of memory cleaning is automatically enabled in unreal engine, so be careful when using UObjects on things that may need to hang by itself.
