1. Setting up multiplayer (a basic one) is as easy as clicking the arrow next to "play" in the unreal editor and selecting the number of players in the level/game/map.
Note that as of unreal 4.25, you need to set the net mode as "play as listen server". See https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7761712#overview

2. Use source tree (free!) to run version control on unreal engine programs https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealmultiplayer/learn/lecture/7761712#overview time 10:20.

3. Synchronus means "together at the same time" such as mmo's, persistent worlds, and most fps first person shooter games. Turn based games like chess played through
email are Asynchronus because you take turns and there is time lag and you each take "turns" playing.

4. Each player "state" is updated when you receive inputs from every other player in the game/network. That means the slowest connection speed is the weakest link
in this state. It's very insecure and slow. A central authority server fixes this and prevents obvious cheating. See
