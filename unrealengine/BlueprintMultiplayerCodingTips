the animation blueprint source in order to get the data we need to feed into the blend spaces

***Make sure you're editing in the HUD blueprint and NOT the gamemode blueprint, otherwise you won't see the correct pins and variables and functions!

20. Then add to viewport blueprint https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-4-multiplayer-team-based-fps-in-blueprints/learn/lecture/20594562#overview

We use layered blend per bone node in animation /anim locomotion state. We add bone names under the layer setup after selecting the layered blend per bone node

22. When adding animations and blends, don't forget to uncheck loop animation unless you want it looping all the time.

23. Using ratios to queue up the next animation sequence

This doesn't seem to work in unreal engine 4.27 but if you make sure the sequence pin node attaches to the set nodes before is falling and is moving, it should
work again as unreal 4.27 changed and removed / simplified functions from unreal 4.15.
