134. ***AVOID naming blueprint variables "Class" or anything similar as it completely bugs out the blueprints and causes it to not show up in your spawn actor bp

135. ***Apparently when dealing with spawn actor by class, the select node is also buggy, so you need to create a class variable of the type of blueprint class
you want, set it to class reference (purple color) then use the select node from that to continue using your enumerator enum sets and hook everything up to the
spawn actor by class bp

Must do this for all the required check boxes at top.

145. Instead of spawning multiple instances of particle fx systems and sound effects, it may be better for optimization purposes to loop them all until you stop
firing your gun if they are some kind of full auto burst fire. This obviously reduces cpu and server load.
