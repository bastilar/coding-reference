1 - Sprite atlases can take a bunch of 2d sprites and combine it into one or very small containers to reduce project performance lag https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteAtlas.html
seems important if my game eventually has a trillion sprites or something...

2 - 2D animation tutorials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj21oIuPNwE&list=PL7pZIxQeCqI0faAd1J47OklQR5giszQFP&index=3 create 2d skeletal rig then using C# code script the input controls and create animation movement while moving

3 - Ray cast 2d and raycast for collision detection for images, canvases, and 2d sprites https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971880/unity-c-sharp-raycast-mouse-click

4 - Create a public class called "interactable" and assign that script as a component to any object you want to interact with such as doors, lootable objects, keys, chests, etc.
make sure to create an interactable object using interactable class and set that to equal to the ray2d hit cast if there is any to check for collision.

5- RPG Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLhj7SfaxSE&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4KLGCCAciWQ5qHudKtYeP7&index=7 Used it for coding base of game for 
basic RPG elements.

6- Have enemy shoot at player when moving https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOzhE3_P2Mk includes how to use GameObject.findwithtag 
object in Start() method.

7- NEVER SET MASS on an object to NEAR ZERO. It causes some seriously odd glitches in Unity. Lost 4 hours of hard work reverting
the project because if that one stupid simple change.

8- If you must use Dynamic bodies but don't want players or objects to be moved by other objects hitting hit like bullets, set mass 
difference to be pretty big.

9- How to find game objects by tag https://forum.unity.com/threads/how-to-find-a-gameobject-by-tag.172188/
GameObject.FindWithTag(string tag) is what you need:

10 - surprisingly hard to find info on good healthbars. i wound up using this one from brackeys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLfNP4Sc_iA&t=814s
might need to change from canvas to jsut image though in case in future too many canvases cause glitching, or something.

11 - gradient.Evaluate(slider.normalizedValue); could be used to trigger events (not just fill color changes) when the helath or some progress
bar goes up or down at certain points https://youtu.be/BLfNP4Sc_iA?t=727 could be useful for al ot of things. music changes at 60% hp or whatever

12 - Also note when making hp bars or i guess any kind of bars, put it in lateupdate funciton so it runs every frame but after everything else
to avoid weird glitching. https://youtu.be/BLfNP4Sc_iA?t=1056
