Failed to 'network-remove' GameObject because it is missing a valid InstantiationId on view: View XX on XXXXXXX (scene). Not Destroying GameObject or PhotonViews!.
Photon PUN does not instantiate an InstantiateID if you manually add an object to the scene because you did not use PhotonNetwork.Instantiate
As of 2/24/2020, photon pun requires you to manually oversee each manually created object, so it might be best to use a item spawner/loot table to clone the items you want and if you don't want it to respawn, just have it spawn once.
